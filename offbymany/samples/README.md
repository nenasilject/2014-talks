This directory contains two executable code samples, meant to be run with `go run`.

[gatt_server.go](./gatt_server.go) starts a simple gatt peripheral, as discussed in the talk.

[ble_http.go](./ble_http.go) starts a gatt peripheral that handles HTTP requests. It is meant to be used with the [BLEBrowser](../BLEBrowser) OS X app from this repo.
